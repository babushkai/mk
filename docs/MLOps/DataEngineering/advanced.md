## 1. Idempotent
An idempotent operation is one that can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application. In data engineering, this concept is crucial for ensuring reliability and consistency, especially in distributed systems where the same operation might be retried due to network issues or failures.

## 2. Monoid
In mathematics, a monoid is a set equipped with an associative binary operation and an identity element. In data engineering, monoids can be used to model data processing operations that can be combined and applied in any order, which is particularly useful in parallel and distributed computations.

## 3. Decoupled
Decoupling in software and data engineering refers to separating components so that they are independent and changes in one do not directly affect the others. This approach enhances modularity, makes systems easier to maintain, and improves scalability.

## 4. Dependency Injection
Dependency Injection is a design pattern in which an object receives its dependencies from external sources rather than creating them internally. It's a way to achieve inversion of control, making code more modular and testable.

## 5. Unit
In the context of software development, a unit is the smallest testable part of any software. In unit testing, developers test individual units or components of a software separately from the rest of the application.

## 6. Functional Programming
Functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It emphasizes the use of pure functions, immutability, and declarative rather than imperative programming. This paradigm is known for its robustness and is often used in data processing pipelines.

## 7. Asynchronous vs Parallel Programming
Asynchronous Programming: Involves executing operations asynchronously, allowing a program to continue executing without waiting for the asynchronous operations to complete. It's typically used to improve responsiveness.
Parallel Programming: Involves executing multiple operations or tasks simultaneously, often leveraging multi-core processors. It's used to increase performance and efficiency.

## 8. Thread Locking
Thread locking is a synchronization mechanism to prevent multiple threads from accessing the same resource (like memory or data) simultaneously, which can cause race conditions and inconsistent data states in concurrent programming.

## 9. Eventual Consistency
This is a consistency model used in distributed systems. It allows for temporary inconsistencies between distributed copies of data, with the guarantee that all copies will eventually become consistent.

## 10. Exactly-Once Semantics
This term refers to ensuring that a particular operation or transaction is executed exactly once, even if the request to perform the operation is received multiple times. It's crucial in distributed systems to prevent duplication.

## 11. Lambda vs Kappa Architecture
Lambda Architecture: Combines batch and stream processing methods. Data flows through two paths: a batch layer for comprehensive and accurate views, and a speed layer for real-time processing.
Kappa Architecture: Simplifies the Lambda architecture by only using a stream processing approach. All data is treated as a stream, eliminating the need for separate batch and speed layers.

## 12. Push/Pull Architectures
Push Architecture: Data is "pushed" to the processing system as soon as it becomes available.
Pull Architecture: The processing system "pulls" data when it's ready to process it.

## 13. Write-Audit-Publish Pattern
This pattern involves three stages:

Write: Data is written into the system.
Audit: Data is validated and audited for correctness and completeness.
Publish: Once validated, data is made available for further use, such as reporting or analysis.
