If you are willing to stay in tokyo in the shared house. Oakhouse is the great place to take a look. They have a large number of real estates across Tokyo, which are oriented to accommodate the foreign citizens. Although Covid-19 had an impact on their business, leading to the down-scaling of their business, I still find the competitive value especially considering the fact that **you can stay only with your passport** and without **敷金(Shikikin)** and **礼金(Reikin)** 
I myself lives once there and my experience was quite awesome with free morning coffee and launge with fast wifi facility.
