The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a framework that is used to understand and describe the different layers of a networked communication system. It divides the process of communication between two systems into seven different layers, each with its own specific functions and responsibilities.

The seven layers of the OSI model are:

Physical Layer: This layer is responsible for the physical transmission of data over the network, including the medium (e.g. copper wire, optical fiber) and the signaling method (e.g. voltage levels, modulation).

Data Link Layer: This layer is responsible for providing reliable communication between devices on the same local network segment by creating, maintaining, and terminating links between devices.

Network Layer: This layer is responsible for routing data packets between different networks and providing logical addressing so that devices on different networks can communicate.

Transport Layer: This layer is responsible for providing end-to-end transport of data between applications on different devices, ensuring reliable communication and error-checking.

Session Layer: This layer is responsible for establishing, maintaining, and terminating sessions between applications on different devices.

Presentation Layer: This layer is responsible for translating data between the application and network formats, and for compressing and encrypting data to protect it during transmission.

Application Layer: This layer is responsible for providing a user interface and services to applications, such as file transfer and email.
