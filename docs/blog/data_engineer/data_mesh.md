What are Data Lakes and Data Meshes?
In this article, we will introduce the concepts and meridians of Data Lake and Data Mesh, which are data infrastructure architectural patterns.

What is Data Lake
A storage repository that can store big data as raw data, or an architecture that centrally manages such data, is called a data lake.
In particular, it is characterized by the ability to centrally manage all types of data (unstructured data), including audio, video, and SNS logs.
In order to utilize big data analysis for management strategy, it is adopted from the background that a repository for collecting, accumulating and storing huge amounts of management data is necessary.
